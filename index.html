  <h1>Toni Cannoli</h1>

  <h3>At the moment:</h3>
  <p>Web programming and computer security student.</p> 
  <br />
  <h3>Studies and skills:</h3>
  <p> I studied philosophy at the UGR and have written some articles of dubious quality on political philosophy.

    I spent some time working as a level designer and programmer on UnrealEngine4 for a video game company whose business model is based on trading limited nft parts that we create ourselves. 
    I also spent time as a representative for models selling their products.

    Beyond that, all my merits can be seen on GitHub or maybe in a future blog, perhaps better than this one.</p>
